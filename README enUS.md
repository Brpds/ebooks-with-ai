# Ebooks-with-AI for Tonnie - Java and AI in Europe

This repository was created as an assignment for Tonnie’s bootcamp – Java and AI in Europe.  
The challenge was to create an ebook using Artificial Intelligence tools to generate the content. For this, I used ChatGPT for the written material and Microsoft Bing’s image generator for the artwork.  
We were asked to include the prompts used in the tools, but a bit of context is needed to explain why I’m sharing the full chat instead. ChatGPT has an internal memory for logged-in users, storing preferences and information to tailor its responses based on what it has already learned. My GPT, for instance, knows that I call it “Chaptain” – a blend of Captain, CHAT, and GPT – that I mostly use it in English (though for this challenge I used Portuguese prompts in GPT and English ones only for DALL·E), that I do brainstorming, thought-process evaluations, ask for suggestions and refinements, question the reasoning, and above all, that I like solving things “with my own hands” so I can build my own neural connections before going for the final option: “just give me the solution.”  
Basically, it's a knowledgeable teacher and I’m the curious kid with a million questions. It's unbelievably productive!  
I used two different chats, and at times GPT went “silent” because I had to focus on other higher-priority activities. There’s no personal or sensitive information – just my first name once – so there’s no issue in sharing the chats.
And, as it said itself: Quest Complete! 🎯  
Oh, one small note: at first, I understood the assignment as a free-topic one, which is why my initial idea was the HomeGym ebook. After some thought, I assumed it should be about coding. Since the HomeGym ebook was nearly finished and the creation process was already “chewed through,” I saw no problem in creating another, simpler ebook on programming languages. I could’ve asked the platform Experts, but with 11,341 students (at first commit's time) in the bootcamp – imagine all of them wanting feedback?! – I figured it’d be a good way to exercise creativity. Neural links, remember?! BRAINPOWER!  

Honnorable mention to Microsoft Copilot for helping me with the reviewing process.
